# PlayUnblockWebsites

A simple website that opens windows for the following websites:
- discord.com
- character.ai
- poki.com
- neal.fun

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. The websites will load in iframes, and a basic script will attempt to unblock them.

## Note

Actual unblocking of websites typically requires a server-side proxy or VPN, which is not included in this simple example. The `proxy.js` file is a placeholder for a proxy server script. You would need to implement server-side code to handle proxying requests.
